This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### 내용 정리

- react is use component!!
- 리액트는 컴포넌트를 사용해서 HTML처럼 작성하려는 경우에 필요하다....
- 자바스크립트와  HTML사이의 이러한 조합을 jsx라고 부름 -> 리액트에서 나온 유일한 개념 (특화된 개념, 다른 분야로 가면 이 개념이 도움이 되지 않을거임..)
- jsx는 javascript 안에서의 HTML 이라고 생각하면 된다.
- 컴포넌트를 만드는 방법에 대해서 학습함
- js 파일에 export라인을 추가 하면 다른 js 파일에서 import 가능(안할경우 컴파일 에러가 남.)
"""javascript
export default Potato
"""

- react application은 오직 한개의 component만을 렌더링 함.
